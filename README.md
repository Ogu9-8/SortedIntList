# Task
The task was from 2018/2019. A linked list for integers should be implemented, which automatically sorts
all elements inside the list in natural order (smallest to biggest). Following methods should be
included:
<ul>
    <li>size
    <li>contains
    <li>isEmpty
    <li>toString
    <li>add
    <li>remove
    <li>removeIndex
    <li>indexOf
    <li>lastIndexOf
    <li>clear
</ul>
The implementation should be accessible through a <strong>command line interface</strong>. Only the
usage of the provided helper class <code>Writer</code> and the packages <code>java.lang</code>, 
<code>java.util.regex</code> is allowed.
